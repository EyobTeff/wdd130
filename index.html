            <p> Hello! My name is Eyob Teffera.  I started my educational journey by taking BYU Pathway and got my first certificate in Construction field supervisor, I have been in construction work for the last 15 years of my life but now I have decided to learn a new skill and change career, I don't know if it will be worth to change a job at the ends of 30's. I have a general understanding of computers, and with your help, I can safely navigate this huge and complex technology field. I'm ready to learn and enjoy this journey. I enjoy the outdoor, nature and wildlife...</p>
